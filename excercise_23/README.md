# 23 - File Overlap

[Excercise link](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/14/23-file-overlap.html)

Given two  .txt  files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping.  One    [.txt file](http://www.practicepython.org/assets/primenumbers.txt)  has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and  the [other  .txt  file](http://www.practicepython.org/assets/happynumbers.txt)  has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can  look it up on Wikipedia . The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)
